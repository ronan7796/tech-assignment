# Orchestration & Scaling (Conceptual)

This document outlines best practices for scaling the **Countries ETL pipeline** to handle large datasets (100M+ records) efficiently across crawling, file processing, CDC replication, and overall performance

---

## Crawling

- **Parallelize crawlers**  
  Use a worker pool, `asyncio`, or distributed execution (e.g., Kubernetes Jobs) to crawl multiple sources concurrently

- **Respect source rate limits**  
  Avoid being blocked by implementing throttling and retry logic

- **Use caching and incremental crawling**  
  Crawl only new or modified records to reduce unnecessary data transfer

- **Message queue buffering**  
  Use a distributed message queue such as **Kafka** or **Amazon SQS** to buffer crawled events before ETL processing

---

## File Processing (CSV vs Parquet)

- **Prefer Parquet over CSV**  
  - Parquet is **columnar**, **compressed**, and **splittable** by row groups
  - This results in smaller storage and faster reads, especially for analytical workloads

- **Partition data by attributes**  
  Example:  
  ```
  s3://bucket/countries/year=2025/month=10/day=05/
  ```

- **Avoid large monolithic CSVs**  
  Use **partitioned Parquet shards** instead (recommended file size: **128MB–1GB**)

- **Example Parquet layout**
  ```
  s3://bucket/countries/region=asia/year=2025/month=10/day=05/
  ├── part-0001.parquet
  ├── part-0002.parquet
  └── ...
  ```

## CDC Replication

- **Use native logical decoding plugins**  
  e.g., `pgoutput`, `wal2json`, or `test_decoding` for PostgreSQL logical replication

- **Maintain dedicated replication slots**  
  One slot per streaming consumer to ensure reliable offset tracking

- **Handle high-volume data**  
  - Use **Kafka** as an event bus for buffering and decoupling
  - AWS DMS can publish CDC streams to **Kinesis** or **S3**
  - Consider using **Debezium + Kafka** for more advanced CDC pipelines

- **Monitor WAL retention and replication throughput**  
  Ensure sufficient disk space and compute for WAL segments
  Use fast networking and properly sized DMS instances

---

## Performance & Scalability

- **Use batching and bulk operations**
  - PostgreSQL: use `COPY` for large inserts instead of individual `INSERT` statements
  - S3: use **multi-part uploads** for large Parquet or CSV files

- **Leverage compute autoscaling**
  - Use **AWS Glue**, **EMR**, or **Spot instances** for large-scale data transformations
  - Scale compute clusters dynamically based on job size and queue backlog

- **Monitor and shard large tables**
  - Shard or partition tables by time or region (`year`, `month`, `region`) to improve query and insert performance

- **Use appropriate storage for analytics**
  - Use **columnar / OLAP databases** (Redshift, Athena, or Snowflake) for large-scale analytical queries
  - Keep **PostgreSQL** normalized and optimized for OLTP (operational workloads)

## Summary

| Area | Key Practices |
|------|----------------|
| Crawling | Parallelize, respect rate limits, use caching, queue buffering |
| File Format | Prefer Parquet, partition by date/region, avoid giant CSVs |
| CDC | Use logical decoding, replication slots, Kafka or Debezium |
| Performance | Batch operations, autoscaling, sharding, OLAP for analytics |

By following these scaling principles, the ETL and CDC pipelines can handle growth from thousands to **hundreds of millions of records** efficiently, ensuring high throughput, resilience, and cost-effective performance
